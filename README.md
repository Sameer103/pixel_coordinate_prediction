# Predicting the Location of a Single White Pixel in a 50x50 Image using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project aims to predict the coordinates (x, y) of a single white pixel (value 255) in a 50x50 grayscale image where all other pixels are black (value 0). The project involves generating a dataset, building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluating its performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies:

## Clone the Repository
* git clone https://github.com/Sameer103/pixel_coordinate_prediction.git
* cd pixel-coordinate-prediction
* Create a Virtual Environment python -m venv venv
  
## Install Dependencies 
* pip install -r requirements.txt

## Output
The Jupyter notebook includes plots of:

* Training and validation loss over epochs.
* Training and validation accuracy over epochs.
* Ground truth vs. predicted coordinates for sample test images.
